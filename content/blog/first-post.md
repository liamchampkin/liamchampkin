  Zwift recently underwent it’s biggest UI change since it launched in 2017.  As an avid user of Zwift I thought I would discuss how it has affected me and what changes the Zwift HQ could make to improve the experience.

First of all I would say that I use all of Zwifts main features except training plans. I race, I do workouts and I sometimes just open Zwift to ride at my own pace.

The racing experience hasn’t changed too much for me since the UI change but I’ll get onto how Zwift could improve the race experience later on in the article.

The most common feature I use is just jumping on Zwift and riding my bike. This might be to do an easy effort to stretch the legs or practice a threshold effort. What I liked before the UI change was to view at a glance, a map of a route to see what climbs are on route and at what point they appear. This allowed me to see where and when I should be riding at my limit and when I can take it easy and for how long. The new UI presents the name of the course which is a little meaningless to me, the distance and the elevation. To see the route profile I have to click on it. This can be a little time consuming if I know the kind of riding I want to do but I’m not sure what route suits my ride.

Being able to toggle the maps on and off would be a great addition to the UI. Other enhancements could be a list of favourites.

I think the UI is a little busy when selecting a route. Workouts are buried within the route selection screen. Maybe breaking up the initial screen into Just ride, workout and race would help focus the UI on a specific section of the game would help the user focus on what they intend to do. As a user I roughly know what I will do before I load the game. For instance, I will select a race using the companion app beforehand or if I’m feeling good I might do a TT effort or a workout.

As I said earlier on, the race UI hasn’t changed a great deal. I select a race in the companion app on my phone and then closer to the race time I’ll load the game and do a little warm up before the countdown reaches 00:00. If I’m racing in my lunch break, time can be quite tight. I might not have time to warm up or even select the right bike that will help me in the race. There’s nothing worse than loading a race and being on a TT bike with 10 seconds to go. (you can’t draft on a TT bike so you will have a serious disadvantage to the other riders).

To improve this it would be great to have two or three bike setups ready to go at the click of a button. For example if the race is in the hills it would be great to have a lightweight frame and wheels ready to go. At the moment to save time, I’ll select the Tron bike so I don't have to spend time selecting the right wheelset.

An even better improvement to the whole game experience is to allow bike, course and workout selection within the companion app. I’m sure this is already heavily requested and already on Zwifts list of todos.

One other issue I’ve found in the new UI is using icons for the main navigation. I’m not familiar with them so I have to select them to find out their meaning. A bit of backup text to save time and guesswork would be an improvement here.
