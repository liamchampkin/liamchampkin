Good to back on the decks. I cracked open a beer and played about an hours worth of techno, no playlist or order, just randomly playing tracks that I've collected over the past month or so.

Loving the techno scene at the moment. You could say this set is more like trance towards the end which is no bad thing although what genre it falls into will divide opinion. Hope you enjoy the journey.
