Just as summer is kicking in over here in the UK I thought I'd jump on the decks and put together a live mix containing lots of tracks I've been enjoying over the past couple of months. Tracks and remixes by Powel, Petar Dundov, Buda Kid and Tom Demac. A bit of a bouncy melodic mix this one. Enjoy.
