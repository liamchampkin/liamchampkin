## Bike to and at work! By Veerle Pieters

If you are into bikes and architecture then give this [blog post](https://medium.com/@veerlepieters/bike-to-and-at-work-a3189932b714#.pxb73ng2b) by Veerle Pieters a read. It shows the new Sram headquarters based in Chicago. If you're not familiar with Sram, they are basically a direct competitor to Shimano, producing bike components such as gears and brakes. This is exactly how places of work should be, cycle and fitness friendly.

## HTTP what?

A few months ago I had no idea on the differences between http1.1 and http2. A shoptalk show by Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier filled me in with the basics and I liked the sound of having a site perform better under https. [Mariko Kosaka](https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/859958929484337152/photo/1) then drew some diagrams to show the differences and now I am fully up to speed. (I think!)

So from what I understand site load times will be quicker and there is no need to group image sprites to save time. There will be one request for all images.

## Sideways dictionary

A good looking easy to use [website that describes technical words using analogies](https://sidewaysdictionary.com/?utm_content=buffer0ee83&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#/term/cookie) rather than definitions. For example;

>**Cookie** - It’s like a barista with a good memory. So every morning when you come in for your decaf soy latte with an extra shot and cream, they nod wearily and say ‘The usual?’

## How outdoor clothing brand Patagonia was built

I really enjoyed listening to this interview with [Yvon Chouinard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvon_Chouinard) the man who formed outdoor clothing brand [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/). He talks about how the company nearly failed and its unique philosophy on doing business. I am a bit of a latecomer to this podcast series but loving it so far, it's really well produced.
