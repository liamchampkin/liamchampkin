All the music I've enjoyed throughout 2023. I'll add to this list as the year goes on.

## Voyage de Lux with Alex Downey - 25.01.2023 (mixtape)
Two hours of really nice techno and acid from Alex Downey.

## Arctic Monkeys - The Car (album)
One of the best bands of all time in my opinion.

## Jon Gurd Mixtape - Autumn 2022 (mixtape)
Lots of different electronic styles featured in this mixtape from Jon Gurd. Some of the selections are a bit on the cheesey side but good to hear something a bit different.
