All the music I've enjoyed throughout 2023. I'll add to this list as the year goes on.

## Radio Show with Powel

The usual laid back house music goodness from Powel. Great working music.

## Reflections Presents: A Quiet Winter Walk by Jessie Marcella

I often stick this on in the evenings when I need to wind down. Awesome selection by Marcella, featuring Nils Frahm, Ã“lafur Arnalds, Rival Consoles and a few from herself.

## Jon Gurd Mixtape - Spring 2023

So far this is my Summer mixtape. I reach for this when when the sun is out or I'm struggling to know what else to stick on. It has a bit of everything and it's over two hours long.

## Ute Mix Series #69 | DJ MARIA.

Deep driving full on Psy Techno... :)

> In this mix she amplifies a swirling deep trip with intense, evocative sounds and captivating 4/4 rhythms. The mix invites to a jungle-like musical fantasy, focusing on psychedelic techno, drawing a line between acid and trance, with a sensitive energy control.

## 100% Kessler Mix (BBC R1Xtra | Emerald)
A couple of years old now but I still enjoy listening to this one. If you enjoy melodic breaks stick it on.

## The Anjunadeep Edition 429 with James Grant
I'm increasingly finding the Anjunadeep Edition a bit hit and miss but this one by James Grant hits the spot. Such a shame that the Anjunadeep guys have removed their podcast streams.

## MNMT 361 : Repart
This is techno but more of a relaxed, deep driving tribal type. I have had this one on repeat for the last few months.

## Voyage de Lux with Alex Downey - 25.01.2023 (mixtape)
Two hours of really nice techno and acid from Alex Downey.

## Arctic Monkeys - The Car (album)
One of the best bands of all time in my opinion.

## Powel - Playing music to a wall 4 (mixtape)
Laid back deep house from German DJ/Producer Powel.

## Jon Gurd Mixtape - Autumn 2022 (mixtape)
Lots of different electronic styles featured in this mixtape from Jon Gurd. Some of the selections are a bit on the cheesey side but good to hear something a bit different.
