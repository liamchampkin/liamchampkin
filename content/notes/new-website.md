  My website takes on a new format. Read about why I've decided to redesign it and what I hope to achieve with it in the future

---


Usually when I decide to re-design my website I'll try and learn a new language or framework at the same time. This approach usually takes a while and I'll often go through multiple design iterations and may never launch it.

Although this is a great way to learn, and I've learnt a hell of a lot of Vue within the last 18 months, I feel I've been doing it the wrong way round. What I should be doing is getting a bare minimum website out the door in a framework/cms I want to learn and publish it. Then go about adding new features and learning how the thing works.

So here it is... a website built on Nuxt 3 (Vue), an application framework [which recently launched its third iteration](https://nuxt.com/v3).

## Out with the old

My last site was built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and while that was a nice learning experience, I found the time it took to build the site too slow. It was on an older version of Jekyll and I'm sure it has improved now. It was also primarily a portfolio rather than a blog. The sites it showcased are now mostly offline and a few years old now. I'm yet to decide if I want to showcase my current side projects.

## Next steps

I've decided to make this sites [Github repo public](https://github.com/liamchampkin/liamchampkin) so you can see everything I do, how I write my CSS, new Vue components, blog posts, amended spelling mistakes and just general indecisive design decisions.

I will also challenge myself to write more articles, especially short posts that I would normally put on Twitter (you should own your content now right?) and hopefully write a few long analytical pieces too. If you're interested in accessibility, front end code and design systems then check back soon. I'll also add the odd underground mixtape :)
