I don't do many freelance projects these days but when I do I usually make sure the project is super simple or a project that allows me to learn something new in my own time.

This project is the latter. When this project came up I was trying to get my head around React at the time but was told by an ex colleague to give Vue a try. I set up a couple of Vue apps locally and preferred it to React instantly.

While I was intrigued with Vue I was asked by a friend if I would be happy to build them a simple blog so decided to use Nuxt. Usually I would reach for  Wordpress and with another client I probably would've played the safe game but as there was no deadline I quite fancied the challenge.

## The brief

* A super simple magazine style blog
* Mobile optimised
* Lots of photography
* Easy to read
* Translates well to Instagram

There were no brand guidelines or design preferences so I had a blank canvas. As the site was a simple blog there was no real need for wireframes as such, I basically sketched out a rough idea to make sure we were on the same page and then I began to create a rough design in Figma...

## Early design in Figma

Although I ended up using a few of the patterns in this early design. I was uncomfortable with certain parts...

The logo was too wide, I wanted a logo that would work well within Instagram's profile image.

The bright colours felt like they were competing with the photography and the nav would have to drop beneath the logo as soon as the viewport became narrower.

With those problems in mind, we were fairly happy with the rest of the design and I began to build the site locally.

## Final homepage design
